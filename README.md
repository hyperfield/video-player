## Video Player

This is a video player embedded in a Web page in your browser and is based on a JavaScript class. It contains a play/pause button, a full-screen button, and a volume control / mute button.

The purpose is to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the JS library whose code can be found in the included file `player.js`.

## Installing and launching the player

There is no need to install the player. All that needs to be done is just to open the file `index.html` in your favourite Web browser. You need to make sure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.

The script in `player.js` currently embeds an external video file, which will be streamed when you push the play button on the player. You can also embed a local or a remote video file of your choice.
